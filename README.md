# XenoComm SDK

A high-performance communication framework enabling AI agents to communicate over IP networks with maximum computational efficiency.

## Overview

XenoComm SDK is designed to provide a low-latency, resource-efficient communication layer for AI agents running in cloud environments. The framework prioritizes machine-optimized interaction over human readability, enabling the potential emergence of adaptive, machine-optimized communication protocols.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Network Connections**: Direct TCP/UDP streams optimized for machine-to-machine communication
- **Efficient Capability Discovery**: Compressed representation formats for fast agent discovery and matching
- **Dynamic Protocol Negotiation**: Adaptive selection of communication parameters based on context
- **Direct Data Representation**: Minimal overhead data encoding/decoding optimized for machine consumption
- **Robust Error Handling**: Configurable error detection and correction mechanisms
- **Feedback-Driven Optimization**: Built-in performance monitoring and protocol adaptation
- **Security First**: Integrated encryption and authentication with minimal overhead
- **Language Support**: Core C++ implementation with Python bindings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.15 or newer
- Python 3.8+ (for Python bindings)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xenocomm_sdk.git
cd xenocomm_sdk

# Configure with CMake
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build

# Build
cmake --build .

# Run tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <xenocomm/connection_manager.hpp>
#include <xenocomm/capability_signaler.hpp>

// Initialize connection manager
auto conn_mgr = xenocomm::ConnectionManager();

// Register agent capabilities
auto signaler = xenocomm::CapabilitySignaler();
signaler.register_capabilities(agent_id, capabilities);

// Establish connection
auto conn = conn_mgr.establish_connection(target_agent_id);
```
