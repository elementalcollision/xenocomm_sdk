# XenoComm SDK: Product Requirements Document

## Goal
To provide a software development kit enabling AI agents running in cloud environments to communicate over IP networks with maximum computational efficiency, potentially fostering the emergence of adaptive, machine-optimized communication protocols.

## Core Philosophy
Prioritize speed, minimal resource consumption (compute, bandwidth, energy), and direct representation exchange over human readability or universal standardization for internal agent-to-agent communication. This framework prioritizes machine-optimized interaction, diverging from human-centric designs while acknowledging the need for standard interfaces at system boundaries.

## Required Modules & Functionality

### 1. ConnectionManager
- Establishes and manages low-level, optimized network connections between registered AI agents over IP
- Moves beyond standard HTTP overhead, potentially using optimized TCP or UDP streams tailored for low-latency machine communication
- Required Methods:
  - establish_connection(target_agent_id, preferred_transport_options)
  - close_connection(connection_id)
  - get_connection_status(connection_id)

### 2. CapabilitySignaler
- Allows agents to advertise their capabilities and discover others using efficient, machine-interpretable formats
- Replaces verbose, human-readable descriptions with compressed representations (e.g., hashes, vectors, pointers) for faster discovery and matching
- Required Methods:
  - register_capabilities(agent_id, capabilities_binary_blob)
  - discover_agents(capability_query_binary) -> list[agent_id]
  - get_agent_capabilities(agent_id) -> capabilities_binary_blob

### 3. NegotiationProtocol
- Enables agents to dynamically agree upon communication parameters for a specific interaction session
- Facilitates adaptability by allowing agents to choose the most efficient parameters based on context, task, and agent types
- Required Methods:
  - initiate_session(target_agent_id, proposed_params) -> session_id
  - respond_to_negotiation(session_id, accepted_params / counter_proposal)
  - finalize_session(session_id) -> negotiated_params
- Negotiable Parameters:
  - Protocol version
  - Data Format (e.g., VECTOR_FLOAT32, VECTOR_INT8, COMPRESSED_STATE, BINARY_CUSTOM, GGWAVE_FSK)
  - Compression Algorithm
  - Error Correction Scheme (e.g., REED_SOLOMON, CHECKSUM_ONLY, NONE)

### 4. DataTranscoder
- Encodes agent-native data (internal states, vectors, etc.) into the negotiated, highly efficient transmission format and decodes received data
- Implements the core principle of direct representation transfer, supporting various machine-optimized formats like dense/sparse vectors or custom binary structures
- Required Methods:
  - encode(data_object, negotiated_params) -> binary_payload
  - decode(binary_payload, negotiated_params) -> data_object

### 5. TransmissionManager
- Handles the actual sending and receiving of encoded data payloads over the established connection, applying negotiated error handling
- Manages the low-level data transfer, incorporating necessary error detection/correction suitable for potentially unreliable machine-to-machine streams
- Required Methods:
  - send(session_id, binary_payload)
  - receive(session_id) -> binary_payload (or error indicator)

### 6. FeedbackLoop
- Provides a mechanism for agents to report the outcome or efficiency of a communication interaction
- Essential for enabling learning and adaptation; this feedback can be used to reinforce successful communication strategies and prune inefficient ones
- Required Methods:
  - report_outcome(session_id, success_metric, efficiency_metric)

## Optional Extension Modules

### 1. EmergenceManager
- Facilitates the evolution of communication protocols based on feedback
- Agents can propose variations and evaluate their performance
- Methods:
  - propose_protocol_variant(variant_definition)
  - log_variant_performance(variant_id, metrics)
  - query_adopted_variants(agent_pair / group)

### 2. CommonGroundFramework
- Provides interfaces and hooks for agents to implement strategies for establishing mutual understanding
- Methods:
  - register_alignment_strategy(strategy_identifier, implementation_callback)
  - invoke_alignment(session_id, strategy_identifier)

### 3. BoundaryGateway
- Handles communication with external systems or humans using standard protocols
- Manages translation between internal xenolinguistic formats and external requirements
- Methods:
  - call_external_api(endpoint_url, request_data, headers, method='POST', api_type='REST')
  - translate_for_output(internal_data, target_format='human_text')
  - translate_from_input(external_data, source_format='human_text')

## Implementation Requirements

### Language & Dependencies
- Must be implemented in performance-sensitive languages like C++ or Rust
- Should provide bindings for common AI development languages like Python
- May use efficient binary serialization (e.g., Protocol Buffers, Cap'n Proto) for configuration and metadata

### Architecture
- Must be designed for asynchronous operation to handle network I/O efficiently
- Should provide basic channel encryption (e.g., TLS/DTLS) and agent authentication mechanisms as negotiable options

### Performance Goals
- Minimize latency in agent-to-agent communication
- Optimize for minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, bandwidth)
- Support high-throughput scenarios with multiple concurrent agent connections

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Each module should have comprehensive unit tests covering all public methods
- Test edge cases and error conditions extensively
- Include performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Integration Tests
- Test interaction between all core modules
- Verify correct negotiation and data flow between agents
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests
- Measure and verify latency under various conditions
- Test resource consumption patterns
- Benchmark against standard protocols (e.g., HTTP/REST) for comparison

## Documentation Requirements
