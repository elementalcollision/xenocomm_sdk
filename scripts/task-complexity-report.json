      "taskTitle": "Develop TransmissionManager for data transfer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TransmissionManager implementation into 6 subtasks, focusing on core send/receive functionality, error handling mechanisms, data fragmentation/reassembly, flow control, retry mechanisms, and integration with ConnectionManager.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex networking concepts including error correction, fragmentation, flow control, and retry logic. Each of these components requires specialized knowledge and careful implementation to ensure reliable data transmission."

      "taskTitle": "Add encryption and authentication mechanisms",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the encryption and authentication implementation into 7 subtasks covering TLS/DTLS integration, certificate/token authentication, negotiation protocol extensions, secure key exchange, connection verification, security configuration options, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Security implementations are highly complex, requiring cryptographic expertise and careful attention to detail. The task involves multiple security mechanisms (TLS, authentication, key exchange) that must work together seamlessly while maintaining performance."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Python language bindings",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Python bindings implementation into 6 subtasks covering binding framework setup, core module bindings, memory management, Pythonic interface design, type conversion system, and packaging/distribution.",
      "reasoning": "Creating language bindings requires deep understanding of both C++ and Python, with careful attention to memory management and type conversion. The task depends on many other components being complete, adding coordination complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop CommonGroundFramework extension module",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the CommonGroundFramework implementation into 5 subtasks covering core framework architecture, alignment strategy interfaces, example strategy implementations, extensibility mechanisms, and alignment metrics/measurement.",
      "reasoning": "This module is conceptually complex but more self-contained than other tasks. It requires designing flexible interfaces for alignment strategies and metrics, but has fewer technical dependencies on low-level systems."

      "taskTitle": "Implement BoundaryGateway extension module",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the BoundaryGateway implementation into 5 subtasks covering core gateway architecture, external format adapters (REST, GraphQL), translation mechanisms, rate limiting/caching, and external service authentication.",
      "reasoning": "This module requires integration with multiple external systems and formats, adding significant complexity. The translation between internal and external representations, plus security and performance considerations, make this a moderately complex task."

      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Develop comprehensive test suite",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the test suite development into 7 subtasks covering unit testing framework, integration test architecture, performance benchmarking, stress testing, network simulation, test automation, and coverage reporting.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive test suite for a complex system requires significant effort across multiple testing types. The dependency on all other components being complete adds coordination complexity, and the variety of test types (unit, integration, performance, stress) requires different approaches."

    {
      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Create comprehensive documentation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation task into 6 subtasks covering API documentation setup and generation, integration guides, troubleshooting documentation, best practices guide, performance recommendations, and example documentation for both C++ and Python.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation for a complex SDK requires covering multiple aspects (API reference, guides, examples) for two language interfaces. The dependency on all components being complete adds coordination complexity and requires deep understanding of the entire system."

      "taskId": 15,
      "taskTitle": "Develop example applications and benchmarks",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the example applications and benchmarks task into 5 subtasks covering use case example applications, comparative benchmarking framework, visualization tools, emergent protocol optimization demos, and containerized deployment examples.",
      "reasoning": "Creating meaningful examples and benchmarks requires good understanding of the SDK's capabilities and common use cases. The comparative benchmarking adds complexity as it requires implementing equivalent functionality using different protocols for fair comparison."
